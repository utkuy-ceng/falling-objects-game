<h1>Falling Objects Game</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Falling Objects Game is a dynamic, interactive browser game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control a character at the bottom of the play area, moving it left and right to catch or avoid objects falling from the top of the screen. The game features health points represented by hearts, a scoring system, and a "game over" condition triggered by missing too many items or catching harmful objects.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Player Movement:</strong> Use your mouse to move the player left and right across the play area.</li>
    <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> Catch falling objects to increase your score. Every ten points, a new card with game information or bonuses appears on the side.</li>
    <li><strong>Health System:</strong> Avoid hazardous objects. Catching them will decrease your health, represented by hearts at the top right of the play area.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Difficulty:</strong> The game's difficulty increases as your score gets higher.</li>
